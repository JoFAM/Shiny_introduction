# Controlling reactivity

## Exercise

Reactivity will be demonstrated by an exercise.

During this class, we'll develop an app that :

 - lets the user upload a file & shows the data
 - lets the user select a X and Y variable
 - shows the distribution of both X and Y
 - fits a linear model Y ~ X and shows the results
 - lets the user download the predictions for Y
 
## Working with files

```{r, echo = TRUE}
fileInput("afile","Select a file",
          accept = "text/csv")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
renderPrint({
  str(input$afile)
})
```

## Uploading files

Use `filInput()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
fileInput("afile","Select a file",
          accept = "text/csv")
```

This returns a data frame with following info:

 - **name**: The original name of the file
 - **size**: The size of the file
 - **type**: The [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) of the file **if** the browser could figure it out.
 - **datapath**: the actual location of the temporary file on the server. 
 

## Uploading files

To use the file, you need to use the `datapath` value!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
output$tbl <- renderDataTable({
  read.csv(input$afile$datapath)
})
```

**Sidenote**

The function `renderDataTable` from `shiny` can be extended using the `DT` package. The function `renderDT()` allows for
editable tables where observations can be selected.




## Exercise

Start by:

 - create a 2-file shiny app
 - setting up a page with a sidebar
 - add an upload widget for a file (make the data a reactive value)
 - add a tab with the data table of the uploaded data
 
## Controlling reactivity : only run with input

Problem: When there's no data file uploaded, the data table can't be displayed. 

Solution: `req()` (short for require)

 - tells the observer/reactive expression to only run for `truthy` values.
 - prevents error messages due to missing input
 
A `truthy` value is :

 - a loose, intuitive concept of `TRUE`
 - anything that's not `NULL`, `FALSE`, `""`, `NA`, ...
 - an inclicked `actionButton()`
 
** The value `0` is truthy, even though `isTRUE(0)` is `FALSE`.

## Create a dynamic UI

```{r, echo = TRUE}
sliderInput("max","Select maximum", min = 5, max=10,
            value = 5)
uiOutput("ui")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
output$ui <- renderUI({
  tagList(
    sliderInput("val","Select value",min = 1, 
                max = input$max, value = 1 )
  )
})
```

## Create a dynamic UI : Basics

The function `renderUI`:

 - should return a `tagList` with UI elements (input or output)
 - Is rendered on the UI side using `uiOutput()`.
 - Argument `outputArgs` allows to pass extra arguments to 
 `uiOutput()` if necessary.
 
If output of `renderUI` is `NULL`, `uiOutput` doesn't show anything.

## Exercise

Add the following to the app:

 - A UI with 2 `selectInput`s that let you select a X and a Y variable
 - Add two tabs with a histogram and summary values for
 the variables X and Y
 
## Checking the input with validate

Problem: If you select a factor variable, the histogram won't calculate and an error is shown

Solution: only run the code if the input is numeric with `validate()` and `need()`

 - `validate` takes one or more conditions to test.
 - conditions are evaluated with `need`
 - `need` allows for specific error message
 
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
renderTable({
  validate(need(is.numeric(iris[[input$var1]]),
                "Please select a numeric variable."),
           need(is.factor(iris[[input$var2]]),
                "Var 2 needs to be a factor."))
})
```
 
## Controlling reactivity : action buttons

Problem : the model runs each time one of the variables is
changed. This is a waste of resources.

Solution: Control actions using an `actionButton()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
actionButton("Go","Click me!")
```

gives:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
renderText({paste("Button is clicked",input$Go,"times")})
```

## Controlling reactivity : Isolation

You want the expressive reaction to only run when the button is clicked. This means removing all other dependencies.

 - using `isolate()`: removes dependency from an input

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
renderData({
  input$Go  # The button, but output is not used
  sel <- isolate(input$var) # The actual input, dependency removed
  data <- iris[[sel]]
})
```

 - using `eventReactive`: removes all dependencies except the reactive event
 
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
thedata <- eventReactive(input$Go,{
  iris[input$xvar]
})
renderDataTable({thedata()})
``` 

## Exercise

 - Add the necessary controls so the histograms and the model are only built when both X and Y are numeric.
 - An extra tab `Model` that shows a graph of the model and 
 the model output (use either `verbatimTextOutput` or try the
 `broom` package for tidy output.)
 - Add an `actionButton` to the app in such a way that the model is only calculated when the action button is clicked.


## Downloading files

This can be done with the `downloadButton()` and `downloadHandler()` functions:

**UI**
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
downloadButton("GetData","Download")
```

**server**
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
output$GetData <- downloadHandler(
  filename = "example.csv",
  content = function(file){
    write.csv(iris, file, row.names = FALSE)
  }
)
```

## Exercise

Add a download button that returns a CSV file with :

 - the X variable with its original name
 - the Y variable with its original name
 - a column called `predict` with predictions.
 
Add a download button that lets the user download the plot of the model.

## Types of reactivity

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('roles.png')
```

 - **reactive source**: any input or reactive values
 - **reactive expression**: depends on source, returns reactive value (eg `reactive()`)
 - **reactive endpoint**: depends on source, does not return a value (all output
 and `observeEvent`)
 
## Reactive values

Useful in case you need to keep track of a "state", eg :

 - number of times something is executed
 - a dataset that can be changed in different ways by multiple inputs.
 
Two possibilities :

 - `reactiveVal`: creates a reactive value that can be changed
 - `reactiveValues`: creates a list with reactive values.

**Keep in mind**

 - These are created and used on the server side!
 - They are not dependent on other reactive values
 
## Using `reactiveVal`

**Creation**

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
count <- reactiveVal(value = 0)
```

The value is the initial value for the reactive value.

**Use**
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
newval <- count() + 1
count(newval)
```

 - the value is accessed like a function like a reactive expression
 - the value is changed by passing the new value as an argument
 
## Using a list of reactive values

**Creation**

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
count <- reactiveValues(a = 1, b = "a")
```

The argument name is the name of the element, the value of the argument is
the value for that element

**Use**
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
values$a <- values$a + 3
values[["b"]] <- "Another value"
```

 - the values are accessed like normal lists elements
 - the value are changed in the normal way
 
## Observe events

The function `observeEvent()` creates an endpoint dependent on an action:

 - a reactive value that changed (input or reactive expression)
 - a set of reactive values between curly braces
 
**Example** :

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
observeEvent({input$Go},{
    showModal(modalDialog(
      title = "Important message",
      "The model is running! Be patient.",
      easyClose = TRUE
    ))
  })
```
 
## Observe conditional events

With `observeEvent()`: add the condition in the code block

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
observeEvent({input$Go},{
  if(is.numeric(iris[[input$var1]]))
    showModal(modalDialog(
      title = "Important message",
      "The chosen variable is numeric.",
      easyClose = TRUE
    ))
})
```

For the UI side: take a look at `conditionalPanel`.

## Exercise

Add a reactive value that keeps track of how often the 
current model graph is downloaded.

If the graph is downloaded more than once, display a modal dialog saying
that you downloaded the graph already.

Don't forget to reset the counter when a new model is created!

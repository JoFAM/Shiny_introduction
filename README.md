# Shiny_introduction

This repository contains a selection of course materials for an introductory course in Shiny. It's not complete,
but you are free to use it for your own classes. If you do so, please shoot me a message and use the proper attribution.

Slides are created using RMarkdown and are (partly) interactive. Most of the course is based on the official documentation of RStudio.
That's in my eyes still the best resource to learn the ins and outs of Shiny.
